    Get A Foundation
  </h2>
  <h4>
  This package will help you:
  </h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Know where you really are right now with finances.
    </li>

    <li>
      Determine the money tracking system that works for you.
    </li>

    <li>
      Stay on track and create new saving and spending habits.
    </li>

    <li>
      Prioritize debt repayments to pay back debt at the right pace for you.
    </li>

    <li>
      Save toward important goals (Emergency Fund).
    </li>

    <li>
      Spend money without guilt.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  Changing behaviors around saving and spending money is extremely challenging.  With all of the temptations
  of purchasing in your daily routine, it gets tricky to do anything without feeling like there is a hole in your
  wallet.  Making a shift in behavior takes weeks--at least a month--and having a coach along the way makes
  all of the difference in obtaining the shift.
  </p>

  <p>
  This program is structured so you have frequent contact with your financial planner and coach throughout 
  the course to help ensure you make the changes you want.
