          <p>
            I grew up in a small farming community which provided me with a unique 
            set of life lessons and character traits that I have always tried to 
            carry with me. The two most important qualities- the pillars I have allowed 
            to guide and drive my own life- are loyalty and striving to improve the 
            lives of others. 
          </p>  
          <p>
            When I left home and joined the military I saw these familiar qualities 
            in the people around me. In my comrades, these traits were even stronger 
            than I’d seen back home. Seeing such loyalty and concern for others all 
            around me was a real turning point, and I knew that when I returned home 
            it was going to be important to keep these pillars central to my life. 
            When the time came for me to decide how I was going to do this, helpful 
            financial advice was an obvious choice. 
          </p>  
          <p>
            I didn’t have a lot of financial 
            guidance growing up so I had to teach myself about financial responsibility.
            Picking up these skills had a dramatic effect on my personal life. I knew 
            that sharing this knowledge and skill set was just the way to improve the 
            lives of others that I was looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I started working in the financial industry- gaining more expertise in 
            financial planning and retirement savings- I realized that loyalty and a 
            commitment to others wasn’t a core value of many larger firms. I knew that 
            if I wanted those qualities to be at the forefront of the financial advice 
            that I was giving, I would have to set out on my own.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why I founded Money By Pounds- to give people, especially those who 
            are just starting out on their savings endeavor- a partner they could trust 
            on their journey towards financial stability.  
          </p>  
          <p>
            When it comes to personal financial security, it’s important to know that you 
            have a partner who values your life and goals, and is not afraid to showcase 
            their loyalty to you. That’s just what you’ll have with Money By Pounds- a 
            loyal partner working to improve your life and the lives of others.
