          I wasn't supposed to be a financial planner. 
          </p>  
          <p>

          I grew up in a small farming community in rural Washington. As a child, farming was all I knew. 
          It taught me loyalty and the power of service to others.  
          </p>  
          <p>

          These values bind together and strengthen small communities like mine. 

          </p>  
          <p>
          When I joined the military, I was happy to find a new community that valued loyalty and service to others in the people around me.

          I knew that when I returned home, it was going to be important to keep these pillars central to my life.

          I didn’t have a lot of financial guidance growing up.  

          <br />
          I had to teach myself about financial responsibility.  Establishing financial stability wasn't easy, but it had a dramatic effect on my life.
          </p>  
          <p>
          I came to realize that the knowledge and discipline I had achieved could serve my community.
          </p>
          <p>
          I created Money By Pounds in order to give people, especially those just starting out, a partner they could trust.
          </p>  
          <p>
          When it comes to personal finances, it’s important to know that you 
          have a partner who shares your values your life, who you can trust to guide you toward your goals.
          </p>  

          <p>
          That’s just what you’ll have with Money By Pounds--a 
          loyal partner working to improve your life and the lives of others.
