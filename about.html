      I wasn't supposed to be a financial planner.
      </p>  

      <p>
      I grew up in a small farming community in rural Washington. As a child, farming was all I knew. It taught me loyalty, hard work and the power of service to others.
      </p>  

      <p>
      These values bind together and strengthen small communities like mine.
      </p>  

      <p>
      When I joined the military, I was happy to find a new community that valued loyalty and service to others in the people around me. I knew that when I returned home and started my family, it was going to be important to keep these pillars central to my life.
      </p>  

      <p>
      I didn’t have a lot of financial guidance growing up. 
      </p>  

      <p>
      I had to teach myself about financial responsibility. Establishing financial stability wasn't easy, but it had a dramatic effect on my life.  I have been able to lead my family and children better because of it, and that's the most important thing.
      </p>  

      <p>
      I came to realize that the knowledge and discipline I had achieved could serve others around me and across the world.
      </p>  

      <p>
      I created Money By Pounds in order to give people, especially those just starting out, a partner they could trust, and a coach for their journey to financial stability.
      </p>  

      <p>
      When it comes to personal finances, it’s important to know that you have a partner who shares your values, your life, who you can trust to guide you toward your goals.
      </p>  

      <p>
      I’m Richard Pounds, and I’ll work hard to help you reach your financial goals.
